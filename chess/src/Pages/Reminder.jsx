      "You've shown strong consistency in your opening repertoire. Your win rate with 1.e4 as White is significantly higher than average. Consider expanding your responses as Black to handle aggressive openings more confidently.",

    description:
      "Your recent puzzle performance suggests a good understanding of forks and pins, but you often miss skewers and discovered attacks. Focused tactical training can help sharpen your pattern recognition.",

    title: "Blunder Frequency",
    description:
      "On average, you make 1.8 blunders per game, usually in the middlegame under time pressure. Try to slow down during critical positions and double-check for undefended pieces.",

    title: "Endgame Proficiency",
    description:
      "You perform well in king and pawn endgames but struggle with rook endgames. Practicing basic rook and king vs king endgames can help convert winning positions more reliably.",

    title: "Time Management",
    description:
      "Your blitz games often end in time trouble. You spend too much time on opening moves and not enough in complex middlegame positions. Try practicing with faster time controls to improve decision-making speed.",

      "Your rating has steadily improved over the last 30 days, showing consistent effort and growth. Keep up your daily practice streak to maintain momentum.",
