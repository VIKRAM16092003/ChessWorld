      - Control the center with pawns (e4, d4).

      The opening is the first stage of a chess game. 
      Key principles include:
      - Control the center (especially with pawns like e4 and d4)
      - Develop minor pieces (knights and bishops) early
      - Don’t move the same piece twice unnecessarily
      - Don’t bring out your queen too early
      - Castle early to safeguard your king
    `,

    title: "Middle Game Tactics",
    content: `
      The middle game begins once development is complete.
      Focus on:
      - Tactical patterns: forks, pins, skewers, discoveries
      - Piece coordination and activity
      - Attacking weak pawns or king positions
      - Sacrifices to gain positional or tactical advantage
    `,

    title: "Endgame Strategies",
    content: `
      Endgames are where few pieces remain. Essential concepts:
      - King activity is crucial: bring your king into the fight
      - Master basic mates (king + queen/rook vs king)
      - Understand opposition in king-pawn endings
      - Use passed pawns effectively
    `,
  },
    {id:7,

    title: "Checkmate Patterns",
    content: `
      Learn and recognize common checkmate techniques:
      - Back rank mate: rook/queen mates king trapped by its own pawns
      - Smothered mate: knight mates king trapped by own pieces
      - Anastasia's Mate, Arabian Mate, and more
      Practicing these will help finish games more confidently.

    title: "Pawn Structures",
    content: `
      Pawn structure defines the strategic landscape.
      Important ideas include:
      - Isolated pawns can be weak or strong
      - Doubled pawns may limit mobility
      - Passed pawns are powerful in endgames
      - Pawn breaks can open lines or destroy the opponent's structure
    `,
  },
    {id:9,

    title: "Attacking the King",
    content: `
      A successful attack requires preparation and precision:
      - Open lines (files, diagonals) toward the enemy king
      - Coordinate major and minor pieces
      - Exploit weaknesses in the pawn shield
      - Use sacrifices to open the king’s position
      Calculated aggression often leads to decisive victories.
